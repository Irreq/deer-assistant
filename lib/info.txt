This is a semi-dynamic all purpose assistant that sits on top of your terminal.
The goal of this program is to aid the user in such a way, that they only need
to exit the program when the computer is shutting down. Therefore, this program
does not strictly follow the GNU philosophy of one program should only do one
task. However one could view this program as being a meta-program that interacts
with other programs on behalf of the user.
